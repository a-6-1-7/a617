        <p>A617 walks the blurry line between art and design. Collectible design. Experimental design. To show, to curate, to write, to build, to question, to provoke, to educate, to learn these are the desires. Desire might even be at the center of this adventure. A617 is a nomadic project offering space for discourse about design. A617 is cornmeal.</p>
        <p>With digital, physical, and conceptual presence, A617 challenges convention and presents ideas on a global stage. With an effort to open up conversation and dialogue around material culture, A617 curates exhibitions offering work with integrity, direction and value. A617 was founded in Mexico City by a collective of creatives Age Salaje.</p>
